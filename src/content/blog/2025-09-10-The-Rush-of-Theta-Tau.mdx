## Theta Tau: Fall 2025 Rush
### What is rush and what to know before you go
*Written by Leonardo Losch*
​
### What is Theta Tau?
Theta Tau is recognized as not only the oldest and largest, but also the leading co-ed professional engineering fraternity across many universities throughout the nation. Here at UW-Madison, Theta Tau - Xi Chapter has been gaining a lot of traction over the past few semesters due to a strong, tight-knit culture of engineers dedicated to not only upholding, but expanding and innovating, our work. Focused around Community Service, Brotherhood, and Profressional Development, our organization has come to be known as our own community full of smart, caring, and kind people.
​
### What does rush look like?
So over the next couple of weeks, we have a very full rush schedule with plenty of events for potential new members (PNMs) to show up, meet current members, and see if Theta Tau is a good fit for you. It is important to show up to as many events as possible to establish your interest, but don't worry if you cannot make every single event, we have exemption forms. Starting off this week, we have a few info sessions also paired with community service, as well as professional development events. The goal of these info sessions is not only to share the basic facts of our organization, but also to give you a hands-on glimpse into what we do. Then next week, we’ll transition into some really fun events that are set up to allow for maximum interaction between members and PNMs. After that, there are two invite only events, and after those is when you hear if you have received a bid. Although we are excited by everyone’s interest, rush is about finding a dedicated group who can grow together and keep that close, supportive brotherhood that makes Theta Tau special.

### Hear what our members have to say!
During these rush events, with a large number of PNMs, it can be stressful or intimidating at first, but the bottom line is that all of our members are very, very eager to meet you! Besides, every single member had to go through the rush process as well. So with that, here are some pieces of advice from some of our members.

“Try not to get overwhelmed! It may seem like a crazy week, but it’s actually such a fun time.” - Katie Jenson, Spring 2025

“Try to get to know as many people as possible and ask what they love about Theta Tau and explain why you’re interested.” -Damek Mangum, Fall 2024

“Be yourself! Talk to as many members as you can. Try to figure out if this is the right group of people for you.” -Ryan Hogan, Spring 2023

“Talk to everyone! It can be intimidating, but everyone wants to talk to you too :)” - Violet Urdahl, Fall 2024

​“Don’t be afraid to show your personality! We only have one week to get to know you, so be your authentic self. Talk to as many people as you can and try to get to know them too.” - Sydney Magee, Spring 2024

As you can see, there is evidently a common theme: talk to and engage in genuine conversation with us! There is no pressure, and we are a very friendly group. With that, we are all just as excited as you are and cannot wait to meet you all.
