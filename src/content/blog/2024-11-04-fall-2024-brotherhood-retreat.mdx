Nearing the end of August, 35 of our TT brothers came together for the third annual Xi chapter brotherhood retreat to soak up the last few days of summer. Planned by our very own Allicia Moeller, this brotherhood retreat was held on Catfish Lake in Eagle River WI, where members spent time bonding through brotherhood activities, while also focusing on professional development.


Since the cabin was right on the lake, our brothers were able to go swimming, paddle boarding, and even do yoga on the dock! One of Allicia’s goals for the retreat was for everyone to bond and get to know each other better, especially for members who are newer to the fraternity. One thing that stood out to her as a way to do this was having talks around the bonfire, where members reflected on their favorite things about Theta Tau, and how they wanted to see it grow in the future. An additional highlight of the trip in terms of brotherhood bonding was when the newest members of the fraternity made everyone an Italian dinner. They went all out—wearing chef hats, playing Italian music in the background, and creating a true Italian restaurant atmosphere for the meal.

Another focus of this retreat was professional development. Our current and former professional development chairs Bennett and Ryan led a discussion about their summer internships, what they learned from them, and advice on how to get the most out of an internship. This discussion provided valuable insight into navigating the internship process, and taking a step towards starting a career.

Overall, this years brotherhood retreat was a huge success, with the biggest member turnout yet! We are so excited to continue this tradition and to see what's in store for next year’s brotherhood retreat!
