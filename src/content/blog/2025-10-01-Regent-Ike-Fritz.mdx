## Meet the Fall '25 Regent
### A background of Ike Fritz: your newest Theta Tau - Xi Chapter Regent
*Written by Leonardo Losch*

## About Ike 
With a new semester underway, our chapter has welcomed a new regent to take the lead: Ike Fritz. Ike is currently a senior studying Industrial Engineering, who rushed in the Fall of his freshman year (2022). Ike chose Industrial Engineering because it paired his love for problem-solving, math, and science, along with business management principles. He saw it as a good “middle ground”. He’s also gained valuable industry experience in Orlando, FL, through both a co-op and an internship with Walt Disney World. Originally from Naperville, IL, UW-Madison stood out to Ike for its lake-surrounded campus, the close proximity to home, and, of course, its BIG 10, Midwest charm and prestige.

## Why Theta Tau & Why Regent
Ike, seeking a more personal organization, rushed Theta Tau, hoping to make connections with other engineers outside of classes. Throughout his time rushing, he found that members’ passion rubbed off on him, and he started to really feel a sense of belonging and community. Now, nearly three years later, Ike claims the passion is still very much there and states, “I hope to give back to Theta Tau as it has given me so much over the years”.

When asked why he ran for regent, Ike explained that there is simply so much possibility and potential. He said there are many other leaders and visionaries in the fraternity who want to innovate and expand in ways we have not in the past, such as with our new company sponsorship partners. I asked Ike what has been a strong factor in facilitating this innovation. He responded,  “Everyone feels that they have a voice within the decision-making, and everyone feels at home.” Internal checks are something Ike hopes to really emphasize this semester.  Additionally, he says that he is excited to collaborate with the other leaders of the fraternity and hopes to be the strong voice who can unite everyone to exceed expectations and benchmarks.

## Ike’s Past Experiences 
In the past, he has held two very important positions: Rush Chair and Marshal. First, as a rush chair, Ike got hands-on experience with large scale organization and planning, and learned the importance of engaging with new members. This set him up perfectly for his next role as Marshal, a potential new member educator. In this role, Ike got exposure to what it's like to lead a group of individuals and uniting them under a common goal; upholding the ideas of Theta Tau. He said it was a lot of work and responsibility, but alongside his co-marshal, Katie Mangus, they led a really engaged pledge class. As a member of the Spring 25 pledge class, I can attest that Ike and Katie undoubtedly led by example and helped build excitement for the organization. He helped not only set our class up to be full of active members, but also people who are genuinely enthusiastic to grow and become leaders themselves.

## Looking Towards the Future
Although Ike does not have confirmed plans after graduation, he plans on working on the side of consulting or supply chain and operations. Planning to put his technical skills to work right away, Ike hopes to also leverage his leadership experience, eventually rotating into more of a management role. Beyond just his bright future, Ike hopes to leave a lasting legacy for Theta Tau.
“I hope to not just be a leader myself, but to also encourage others, especially those who will still be in the fraternity after I am gone, to follow their goals, maybe step out of their comfort zone, and also take on leadership roles.” He also says he hopes it stays like a home to all the members and that members keep the strong social community feeling alive. After all, that’s what makes us love this community so much; it is the wonderful people that we are surrounded by. With that, we are all excited to see the positive impact Ike will make as our regent this semester.
